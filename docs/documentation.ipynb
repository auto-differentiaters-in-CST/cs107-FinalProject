    "This package autodiffCST implements automatic differentiation for computational use. It can be used to automatically differentiate functions via forward mode, with the option to perform second order differentiation for inputs with a single value and a list of values and the option to perform higher order differentiation for inputs with a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation, namely, the process of finding the derivatives of functions, is very prevalent in various areas of science and engineering. It can often be used to find the extrema and convexity of functions with single or multiple variables. With the advance of technology, more complicated functions and larger dataset are developed. The difficulty of performing differentiation has greatly increased and we are more dependent on computers to take derivates. Nowadays, we have three major ways of performing differentiation: symbolic, numerical and automatic (algorithmic) differentiation. We will focus on automatic differentiation for the rest of this document."

    "## Section 2: Background\n",
    "### 2.1 An Overview of Auto Differentiation\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) uses algorithms to efficiently and accurately evaluate derivatives of numerical functions. It has the advantage of avoiding symbolic manipulation of functions while reaching an accuracy close to machine precision. Application of automatic differentiation includes but is not limited to astronomy, dynamic systems, numerical analysis research, optimization in finance and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind AD is to break down a function into a sequence of elementary operations and functions that have easily attained derivatives, and then sequencially apply the chain rule to evaluate the derivatives of these operations to compute the derivative of the whole function. This way, we only need to store the value of the function and its derivate at each step without the burden of parsing and remembering the whole symbolic expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode and reverse mode are the two main methods to perform automatic differentiation. These two modes do not differ in their accuracy, but may differ in efficiency when the input data gets large in size. When dealing with more complexed functions or a large number of function, forward mode tends to be more efficient. Some AD algorithms even implement a combination of forward mode and reverse mode. For this project, our package only implements the forward mode and can serve as a good resource for applications such as dynamic systems and mechanical engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand automatic differentiation, let's get familar with some key concepts that are used in the algorithms of AD first. We will use the rest of this section to briefly introduce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Elementary operations and functions\n",
    "The algorithm of automatic differentiation breaks down functions into elementary arithmetic operations and elementary functions. Elementary arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and raising power (we can also consider taking roots of a number as raising it to powers less than $1$). Elementary functions include exponential, logrithmatic, and trigonometry. All of these operations and functions mentioned here have derivates that are easy to compute, so we use them as elementary steps in the evaluation trace of AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The Chain Rule\n",
    "The chain rule can be used to calculate the derivate of nested functions, such in the form of $u(v(t))$. For this function, the derivative of $u$ with respect to $t$ is $$\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial v}\\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general form of chain rule applies when a function $h$ has several arguments, or when its argument is a vector. Suppose we have $h = h(y(t))$ where  $y \\in R^n$ and $t \\in R^m $. Here, $h$ is the combination of $n$ functions, each of which has $m$ variables. Using the chain rule, the derivative of $h$ with respect to $t$, now called the gradient of $h$, is\n",
    "\n",
    " $$    \\nabla_{t}h = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_{i}}\\nabla y_{i}\\left(t\\right)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule enables us to break down complicated and nested functions into layers of operations. Our automatic differentiation algrithm sequencially uses chain rule to compute the derivative of funtions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Evaluation Trace and Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of our automatic differentiation algorithm rests upon the idea of evaluation trace and computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation trace tracks each layer of operations while we evaluate the input function and its derivative. At each step, the evaluation trace holds the traces, elementary operations, numerical values, elementary derivatives and partial derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computational graph is a graphical visualization of the evaluation trace. It holds traces and elementary operations of all the steps, connecting them via arrows pointing from input to output of each step, and thus can help us better understand the structure of the function and its evaluation trace. Forward mode performs the operations from the start to the end of the graph or evaluation trace. Reverse mode performs the operations backwards, while applying the chain rule at each time determining the derivate of the trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we provide an example of a evaluation trace and a computational graph of the function $$f(x,y)=\\exp (-(\\sin (x)-\\cos (y))^2),$$\n",
    "with derivatives evaluated at point $(\\pi /2,\\pi /3)$.\n"

    "\n",
    "The second-order derivative of a function $f$ is the derivative of the derivative of $f$, and often referred to as the second derivative. Roughly speaking, the second derivative measures how the rate of change of a changing quantity. For example, the second derivative of the position of an object with respect to time is the instantaneous acceleration of the object, or the rate at which the velocity of the object is changing with respect to time. On the graph of a function, the second derivative corresponds to the curvature or concavity of the graph. The graph of a function with a positive second derivative is upwardly concave, while the graph of a function with a negative second derivative curves in the opposite way. Along this way, third, fourth, and higher-order derivatives can also be calculated and interpreted as the rate of change of the previous order.

    "### Description of Extension and its Background\n",
    "As mentioned above, our main extension is calculating higher order derivatives using automatic differentiation. Higher order derivatives are prevalent in Numerical Analysis researches, mechanical engineering, astronomy and a number of other fields of application. Most of the times, people are interesting in using derivatives of order 1, 2 and 3, seldomly 4 and 5. Orders higher than such are rarely consider except for pure mathematical and academic purposes. More mathematical background of higher order derivatives is provided in the Background section above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of higher order derivatives is integrated with our main object classes `VAD`. The features differ for single value input and vector input of `VAD`, so we will introduce them separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "For `VAD` and functions of `VAD` with single value input, we can calculate their derivatives up to an arbitrary order specified by the attribute `order`. These high order derivatives are stored in an attribute `higher` and can be accessed through it. Notice that due to the nature of differentiation, most derivatives will become 0 after some times of differentiations, except for the iterative functions including `sin` and `cos`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For `VAD` and functions of `VAD` with vector value input, we can calculate their derivatives up to the second order. This shall be enough for basic applications of differentiating vectors. The first and second order derivatves are stored in attributes `der` and `der2` respectively and can be accessed through them and through functions `jacobian()` and `hessian()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we demoed a case (example 3.4) where our extension could aid Newton's method in the file `using_VAD_for_Newtons_method.ipynb` in the `docs` directory. It is quite an integrated test scheme which utilizes a large coverage of the elementary operations that can be used in our modules. It is highly encouraged to try this test case. "

    "# Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broader Impact\n",
    "We hope our package would be applied to different fields that require doing differentiations via computer programs: physics, engineering, applied mathematics, astronomy, and even other areas that the developers of this package have never imagined. We hope this package can be used to do automatic differentiations accurately and efficiently and can inspire the development of enhanced versions of automatic differentiation packages in the future. We see a number of possibilities that this package could be enhanced and would be happy to see them completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we do not hope to see that this package is used for plagiarism, cheating, or shortcut for doing differentiation. The open-source nature of this package makes it accessible to people, but also susceptible to people who plan to use it for plagiarism. Users should be aware of this nature and wisely choose their way of using this package. This package is not designed for shortcuts of doing differentiation practices. People could use it to check their answers for calculating derivatives by hand or by other algorithms, but should not use it in place of derivative calculation practices. These practices have their purposes and using this package to get the answers does not contribute to the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also see that when working on this project, we connected mathematical ideas such as Leibniz Rule and Faa di Bruno Formula to our automatic differentiation algorithms. Although this should not be the first time when people used these formulas to calculate higher-order derivatives, it was inspiring for us to do the implementation ourselves. We hope our project serves as a case where we bridge the gap between theories and applications. This experience will allow us and many students alike to keep striving for this goal and further tells that this is the best time when all kinds of knowledge come together to facilitate new discoveries.\n",

    "The autodiffCST package and its developer welcome users who are contributors from all backgrounds and identities. We believe excellence in a collaborative project comes from trust, respect, and caring for each other, as it is evident through the process of developing this package. We tried our best to make our package as inclusive and user-friendly as possible with the willingness to reach more people that are interested in this package, by providing fitting documentation and instructions. Admittedly, this package is written in English and Python, but we welcome the contribution from people that are fluent in any language and programming languages. During the process of developing this package, pull requests are reviewed and approved by all developers. Whenever one of us feels the need to initiate a pull request, this person would communicate with other members and reach an agreement together. We would love to bring this positive communication to a future collaboration of this package and beyond."

    "1. In the future, we would like our package to be able to implement higher (>2) order derivatives for vector inputs. We now can handle up to second order, but did not get to implement orders higher than that. Such orders could be useful for some applications.\n",
    "2. We would like to handle functions that contains multiple vector inputs. As of now, we can only perform operations with one vector input `VAD` object, or multiple single value input `VAD` objects. If we were to implement functions with nultiple vector inputs, the Jacobian and Hessian matrices would be much more complicated than what we have now. This could serve as a fitting extension for furture implementations.\n",
    "3. Improve computation efficiency. For instance, we used the Faa di Bruno Formula to calculate higher order derivatives, but is there a more efficient approach, in terms of both time and storage complexity? Possible candidates are using symbolic expression of the function, using Backward Mode and using other formulas. It is yet to explore which one is the most efficient option.\n",
    "4. Further applications. As mentioned above, our modules can already be used in Newton's method and fits applications in areas such as mechanical engineering and dynamic system. As of the higher order derivatve extension, it can be useful in Numerical Analysis and pedagogical purposes. Physics is another area of possible application of our package, since second order derivatives are prevalent."
